I am very excited to announce the launch of my own website. 
This past weekend was very busy. I was refreshing my knowledge in HTML, CSS and Markup learned more about Jekyll and GitHub.

The certification for https:// is still in progress, but there is nothing harmful on the website so please do not get discouraged by this little symbol:

Anyway, today it looks like we are finally up and running! If I don't have firther big issues, then it is finally time to start adding content in here and build a beautiful portfolio webpage as well as maybe do some blogging in the future!
