A demo of a project I worked on a few months back in my training.

**What is Tekla structures?**

Quote from *[Tribles website](https://www.tekla.com/products/tekla-structures)*

*Tekla Structures, the most advanced structural BIM software, lets you create, combine, manage and share multi-material 3D models packed with valuable construction information. You can use Tekla Structures throughout the project, from buildings and infrastructure conceptual planning to fabrication, construction and maintenance, for design, detailing and information management.*

In other words, Tekla allows you to design a complete construction in a seamless fashion, standard profiles, rebar, concrete foundations and all. I love this particular software, because once you get familiar with it (and it has quite the learning curve to it), you as a designer have to do your modelling. 

Once it is ready, you can pull all the drawings you need, and they are being generated automatically for you.
Of course, there is a vast amount of customization you can do in the drawings, but usually what you get automatically is almost good enough to step into detailing for production.
