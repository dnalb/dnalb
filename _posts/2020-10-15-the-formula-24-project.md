# **What is the Formula 24 Project or F24**

Greenpower Education Trust is a UK based charity which gets young people enthusiastic about science and engineering by challenging them to design, build and race an electric car.

We supply age appropriate Kit Cars, which can be built in school, college or elsewhere and raced at motorsport venues at Greenpower organised events. Alternatively, older participants can design and build their own car to our regulations. The Greenpower challenge uses the excitement of motorsport to inspire young people to excel in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM).

# **My participation**

As a part of the VDAB's team for this competition, our CAD class  took the responsibility of creating manufacturing-ready drawings for the whole project.

# **What we began with** was a full assembly of a sample kit car in 3D format.
