description: Hi all, I am currently working on a dummy for an Electricity Pylon model.

The general layout is already created (see dwg down below) - at least the part that suits my needs to model and detail it later with Tekla.    
I've also added a [video](http://localhost:4000/Tekla2#video)
 at the bottom of the page.      

Please note, the structure is not fully detailed, for example I left a lot of clashes between the profiles uncut or unfitted. I made this decision because fully detailing something like this involves a lot of busy work, way too much for a free time project or a project that I do not intend to put straight to manufacturing.    

I used a minimal amount of macros to create it, most of it was hand work. For example the reinforcements at the base diagonals are made with a customisable macro tool which is provided with Tekla.

The rest I made myself by hand because I feel this way is a lot more customizable to the project's specific needs, for example the arms are hand made, including their bracings and reinforcements.

## Initial scheme made in AutoCAD to serve as a guide for creating the GRID and general layout:

Usially in real life we'd receive this from an architect or a civil engineer, but I had to make do with what I had for this one: looking trough the window and using different images I found online as inspiration.
